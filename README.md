## 📖 About the Project

**Spendy** is a finance tracking API that allows users to:

- Register and authenticate securely
- Manage income and expense transactions
- Organize transactions by predefined categories
- **Automatic balance calculation** — balance updates automatically on every transaction
- **Balance validation** — prevents negative balance (insufficient funds protection)
- Generate monthly financial summaries
- Track spending patterns by category and period

The API is designed for browser-based clients and follows modern backend best practices.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **MongoDB**
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**
- **Joi** — request validation
- **Swagger / OpenAPI 3.0** — API documentation
- **Render** — deployment

---

## 🔐 Authentication

The API uses **JWT-based authentication with HttpOnly cookies**.

After successful registration or login, the server sets the following cookies:

- **accessToken** — used for authenticating protected requests
- **refreshToken** — used to refresh the session
- **sessionId** — session identifier

All authentication cookies are configured with:

- `HttpOnly: true`
- `Secure: true`

This approach protects tokens from XSS attacks and eliminates the need to manually attach tokens to request headers.

### ✅ How authentication works

- Cookies are sent automatically with every request
- Protected endpoints are accessible only to authenticated users
- Authorization middleware validates the session on each request

---

## 🧪 Authentication in Postman & Swagger

When testing the API using **Postman** or **Swagger UI**:

- Cookies are stored automatically after login
- No `Authorization: Bearer` header is required
- Protected endpoints work out of the box after authentication
- To test unauthorized access, clear cookies or start a new session

---

## 📋 Available Endpoints

### Authentication

- `POST /auth/register` — Register a new user
- `POST /auth/login` — Login and start a session
- `POST /auth/logout` — Logout user
- `POST /auth/refresh` — Refresh authentication session

### User

- `GET /users/current` — Get current authenticated user

### Categories

- `GET /categories` — Get income and expense categories

### Transactions

> **Note:** Balance is automatically recalculated after every transaction operation.
> Transactions with insufficient funds will be rejected with a 400 error.

## ⚠️ Error Handling

The API uses centralized error handling and returns standard HTTP status codes:

| Code | Description                            |
| ---: | -------------------------------------- |
|  200 | Success                                |
|  201 | Resource created                       |
|  204 | Success with no content (e.g., delete) |
|  400 | Validation error or insufficient funds |
|  401 | Unauthorized                           |
|  403 | Forbidden                              |
|  404 | Not found                              |
